Level 1: Hell's Office
(The initial sentencing, paperwork, and the start of the escape through bureaucratic hell)
Alternative: Infernal Intake, Damnation DMV, Soul Processing Unit 666


Level 2: Deeper into Hell (Post-Escape from the Office)
Premise: Navigating the more chaotic, fiery, and traditionally "hellish" landscapes after breaking free from the initial processing.

Name Idea: Brimstone Boulevard

Why: Sounds like a twisted, dangerous city street or highway. Implies a journey through a more "developed" part of Hell.

Alternatives:

The Fiery Foundries: Suggests industrial, hot, mechanical dangers.

Satan's Scrapyard: Implies a chaotic, junkyard-like environment full of hazards.

Pandemonium Plaza: Highlights the chaos.

The Devil's Detour: He's not on the "official" path anymore.

Level 3: Purgatory
Premise: A transitional realm. Could be monotonous, repetitive, foggy, full of minor trials or existential waiting.

Name Idea: The Monochromatic Maze

Why: Suggests a confusing, visually dull (grey, muted colors) environment where one could get lost, reflecting the uncertainty of Purgatory.

Alternatives:

The Endless Escalators: A very "troll" idea of being stuck in a repetitive, slow journey.

The Waiting Wasteland: Emphasizes barrenness and the act of waiting.

Limbo Line-Up: Another bureaucratic nightmare, just waiting... for what?

The Grey Gauntlet: Focuses on trials in a bland setting.

Level 4: Gateway to Heaven / Lower Heaven
Premise: Reaching the outskirts or initial entry points of Heaven. Might still have bureaucratic hurdles or tests of worthiness, but with a celestial aesthetic.

Name Idea: Cloud Nine Customs

Why: A funny, bureaucratic take on entering Heaven. Imagine angelic customs officers and paperwork on clouds.

Alternatives:

Pearly Gates Pavilion (and a Really Long Queue): Classic imagery with a humorous, mundane twist.

Angelic Admissions: Sounds like applying for college, but in the sky.

Nimbus Checkpoint: A more serious-sounding, but still bureaucratic, entry point.

St. Peter's Sorting Station: Another layer of judgment and processing.

Level 5: Deeper into Heaven / The Core of Heaven
Premise: The supposed paradise. Could be genuinely blissful, or have its own "troll" quirks â€“ maybe it's too perfect, too ordered, or hilariously mundane in its own way.

Name Idea: The Seraphic Servers

Why: Plays on "servers" as in angelic beings AND computer servers. Maybe Heaven is run by a giant, slightly buggy celestial mainframe. Offers potential for "glitch" or "system error" troll mechanics.

Alternatives:

Ethereal Estates: Sounds like a high-end, perhaps slightly sterile, heavenly suburb.

The Hallelujah Headquarters: The central command of Heaven, possibly with more angelic bureaucracy.

Apex of Afterlife: Sounds grand and final.

Cloud Control Central: A slightly more techy/orderly take on managing Heaven.
