## About The Game

"The Time I Got Truck-kun'd to Hell and Decided Upper Management Was an Even Bigger Nightmare" is a 2D platformer that sends you on a frantic, bureaucratic odyssey through the afterlife. After an unfortunate encounter with the infamous Truck-kun, you find yourself in Hell, only to discover that eternal torment is less about fire and brimstone and more about soul-crushing paperwork and demonic middle-managers.

Fed up, you decide to take matters into your own hands and embark on a desperate climb through the celestial hierarchy, from the depths of Hell's corporate ladder, through the chaotic bureaucracy of Purgatory, and into the surprisingly sterile efficiency of Heaven. Will you find peace, or just another layer of management?

## Story Synopsis

It was a day like any other, until it wasn't. One minute you're minding your own business, the next, BAM! Truck-kun. Classic.

You awaken not to pearly gates, but to the fluorescent hum of Hell's orientation office. Turns out, eternal damnation involves a lot more TPS reports than you'd think. The demons are less pitchfork-wielding terrors and more passive-aggressive middle managers obsessed with quarterly soul quotas. This, you decide, is a nightmare far worse than any fire pit.

Driven by a desperate need to escape not just Hell, but its infernal bureaucracy, you begin a chaotic ascent. First, you must navigate the labyrinthine cubicles and hazardous "team-building exercises" of Hell's corporate structure. Then, it's a mad dash through the chaotic, ever-shifting landscapes of Purgatory â€“ a realm seemingly designed by a committee that couldn't agree on anything.

Finally, against all odds, you breach the gates of Heaven. But is it the paradise you imagined? Or just another, albeit shinier, office with even higher stakes? As you navigate its pristine corridors and hyper-efficient systems, you can't shake the feeling that someone, or something, is pulling the strings. Your journey culminates in an encounter with a mysterious, impeccably dressed individual at the very apex of existence. Who is he? What does he want? And is he offering salvation, or just a new, even more terrifying, performance review? The answers, if any, remain tantalizingly out of reach... for now.
